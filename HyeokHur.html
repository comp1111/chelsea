            <p>I learned Game development skills in my high school, like Game designing, Project management, etc.
							 Then I changed my mind to study programming, so I'm here.
							 I have experience in programming. I learned C, C++, C#, Python, Visual Basic on my own.
							 And also I'm working as a part-time junior Graphics programmer.
							 If you guys're interested in making a game or software(web, app anything), feel free to talk to me.
							 I love talking about technology stuff.</p>
