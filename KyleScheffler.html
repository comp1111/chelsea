            <p>Kyle was born in Kelowna B.C. and spent the first 10 years of his life there before moving to penticton for 12 years, and now lives in Burnaby B.C. for his studies at BCIT.
                He loves games, nature, and coding. He has always wanted to make games.
                While doing his studies at BCIT he still spends probably more time than he should playing games</p>
