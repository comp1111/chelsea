            <p>Daria Dimchuk was born in Moscow, Russia, and moved to Canada at the age of 9. <br>Years later, she joined BCIT to try out a programming class, starting with the most basic Java, prior to that only practicing with HTML and CSS. After many part time classes, like C++, C#, and Advanced Java, she applied to CST. Out of all the languages so far, she hopes to work with C++ or C#.
