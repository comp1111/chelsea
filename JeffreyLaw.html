            <p>Hi, my name is Jeffrey. I was born and raised in Vancouver. After graduating from BCIT, I would like to pursue a computer science degree at SFU. 
			If presented the opportunity, I would like to teach in a high school. The area in Computing that I am most passionate about is Artificial Intelligence and Cloud Computing. 
			Needless to say, my favorite course is COMP1111.</p>
            <p>I can be reached at jlaw53@my.bcit.ca</p>
