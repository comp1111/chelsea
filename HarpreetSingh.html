            <p>I grew up in Jalandhar, a major city in Punjab, India. After my high school 
                I came to Canada for further studies and my family moved to England. Basically, I came here to discover life itself (I am a lot into that kind of stuff :P) but discovering new ways to design websites and solve mathematical problems is all I have been doing yet. Hope it gets better in the future. It will, I know. About me? I am good at constructive criticism, I like outdoor sports, story rich games and reading books and yes, I prefer Marvel more than DC! In the pic, thats me being creative, lol!
