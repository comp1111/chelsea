            <p>Although Jason was born in Campbell River, BC, he has lived most of his life plotting his escape from Vancouver Island. 
                He loves computers. This is why he joined the Computing Department
                at BCIT where he hopes to graduate with a Diploma... eventually. Jason isn't sure which area he would like to specialize in,
                and he doesn't understand why he's writing in 3rd person. Needless to say, Jason's favorite course is COMP1100. Also, he does not know why he has a picture of himself with so much booster juice.</p>
            <p>Jason can be reached at jnguyen129@my.bcit.ca</p>
