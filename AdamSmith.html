              I grew up in Winnipeg MB. I've spent the last few years doing a few different things.
              My interest in programming started while I was selling accounting software. Creating software sounded
              more exciting to me than selling it. I started learning some basic web development on my own, then took
              off to travel through Central and South America while I continued to study for a little less than a year.
              When I came back I knew I wanted to dive deeper into software development and decided to come here to
              BCIT. I'm excited to work with all of you and see the types of projects we all come up with!
