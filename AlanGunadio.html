            <p>Alan was born in Indonesia and has moved to Vancouver,BC since 2009. 
                In addition to Skiing and Snow Boarding, he loves computers. This is why he joined the Computing Department
                at BCIT where he hopes to graduate with a Diploma in 2018. Alan still does not know what he is going to specialize in. Needless to say, Alan's favorite course is COMP1111.</p>
